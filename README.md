# NCBS-Project
Evolution of Genetic Code showing that it is a partial optimisation for robustness to translational errors of some random code. A simulation which competes various genetic codes with the current genetic code and predicts the winner over a long run.

The simulation includes a live bar-graph plot which changes every 0.5 seconds which shows the winner over time. The code in Green is the current Genetic Code and the bar-graphs are sorted in the order of their distances from the current Genetic Codes(1 distance== 1 mutation!!) 

Observation: A Genetic Code generated such that it has even more robustness in terms of errors during translation/has a much higher population outpowers the current Genetic Code which shows that the code with more fitness wins over time. Also, population adds a factor due to the horizontal gene transfer!
